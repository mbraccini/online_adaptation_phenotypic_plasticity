Set random seed in run-collision_avoidance_trajectory.argos (and possibly the length of the experiment)

Set bias at the beginning of the file collision_avoidance_trajectory.lua



Run the following commands:


argos3 -c run-collision_avoidance_trajectory.argos | grep pos | tr ',' '.' > traj.txt

(This will produce a file with x,y coordinates every step. The file is named traj.txt)


R --no-save < draw_trajectory.R

(This will produce a pdf file with the trajectory. The file is named trajectory.pdf)

Some example of trajectories are provided in the files trajectory-xyz.pdf
